	<h2>Chicken</h2>
<p>This is a dummy text. I am just practicing so dont take it serious. I started taking driving lessons at a driving school and the cashier, who was also the receptionist asked me to be there the next day by 8:30 am. When got there the next day neither her nor the driver had arrived. I waited for 30 minutes more before I called her to complainabout this waste of my time. She responded saying “That’s the way it is” and that they would start whenever the driver was around and I was to follow others or “orders?”I asked her if she was implying that there was no importance in keeping to time and she hung up.</p>
